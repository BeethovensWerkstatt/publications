# Guidance how to add publications to this repository

## Structure of folders and files

We have different types of publication and each is captured in its own directory: glossary, publication, poster and news.
The publication files should be stored directly in the corresponding folders.
An exception are the poster publications, where there is always a parent folder for each poster, in which the poster plus a descriptive readme.md (place, date, occasion, presenter) is stored.

## Coding language and styleguide

The publications should be coded in markdown.
Use the publication_template.md (especially regarding metadata), to add content to the publication files. 
As a reference the google markdown styleguide should be used.

## Semantic versioning

This repository uses semantic versioning. The version should be provided in the metadata of each file following the structure of the publication_template.md

[semantic versioning]: https://semver.org/lang/de/
